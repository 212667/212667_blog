# Introduction 

Here is a short analyse about the morphology of zooplankton. Most especially about the area they occupy and their size. The graphic I propose will show us if a link exists between these two characteristics. 

# Analyse

```{r retirer valeur extreme}
zooplankton <- filter(zooplankton, density < 1,5)
```


```{r graphique}
chart(data = zooplankton, area ~ size %col=% class) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```
  
  We can observe that there is indeed a link between the size and the area. The more zooplankton occupy a high area, the more they have a big size. The evolution tends to be exponential. We can also see that the class of the Chaetognath is the class that has the biggest size while occupying a short area in contrast with the other classes. The biggest zooplankton that can reach the biggest connection between the area and the size are from the class "Chidarian".
